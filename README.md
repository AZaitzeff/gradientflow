This repository contains code for "Variational Extrapolation of Implicit Schemes for General Gradient Flows" by Alexander Zaitzeff, Selim Esedo\=glu, and Krishnna Garikipati

The file tests.m will run the tests for the numerical results section of the paper. I recommend running the code section by section.
