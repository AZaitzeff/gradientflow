This repository contains code for "Variational Extrapolation of Implicit Schemes for General Gradient Flows" by Alexander Zaitzeff, Selim Esedoglu, and Krishnna Garikipati

The file tests.m will run the tests for the numerical results section of the paper. I recommend running the code section by section.

The file verifystabilityandcons.m verifies that the gamma's in the paper satisfy the stability requirments (Theorem 2.1) and consistency equations (Claim 3.1).
